# What is Machine Learning?

---

# Types of Machine Learning

- Unsupervised Learning
    - We don't have labels
- Supervised Learning
    - We have labels
- Reinforcement Learning
    - Totally different problem
        - Goal-oriented learning

# Parsnip package

- Separate the definition of a model from its evaluation
- Use different packages as engines to train models
- Harmonize argument names for the same algorithms

# Canada - Soccer Crisis

- Has only qualified for 1 World Cup in the last 33 years
    - Lost all 3 games
- In 2014 & 2018 we saw some great improvements on the team
    - 10 games won in the 2014 Qualifiers
    - 12 games won in the 2018 Qualifiers
- World Cup in 2022 & 2026
    
    
### What is the quality level of a given player?

- This helps us: 
    - Improve the quality level of teams
    - Predict how we can improve
